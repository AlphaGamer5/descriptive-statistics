# Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or a sample of a population.  Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of frequency, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion or variation (spread), and measures of position.

### Measures of Frequency
* Formulas: Count, Percent, Frequency
* Shows how often something occurs
* Use this when you want to show how often a response is given
### Measures of Central Tendency
* Formulas: Mean, Median, and Mode
* Locates the distribution by various points
* Use this when you want to show how an average or most commonly indicated response
### Measures of Dispersion or Variation
* Formulas: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
* Identifies the spread of scores by stating intervals
* Range = High/Low points
* Variance or Standard Deviation = difference between observed score and mean
* Use this when you want to show how "spread out" the data are.  It is helpful to know when your data are so spread out that it affects the mean
### Measures of Position
* Formulas: Percentile Ranks, Quartile Ranks
* Describes how scores fall in relation to one another. Relies on standardized scores
* Use this when you need to compare scores to a normalized score (e.g., a national norm)

The foundation of any data science project requires analysis using the descriptive statistics found in this project.  The primary goal here was to code descriptive statistics from scratch with examples to allow users to simply observe the inner-workings of the Python statistics library.  Links are provided below to Joel Grus' book and the code and examples from the statistics portion on GitHub.
